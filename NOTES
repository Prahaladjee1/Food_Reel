THERE IS MAINLY TWO THING IN THIS BACKEND 
I> USERS :-- food reels ,View food Items
ii> FOOD PARTNER :-  List food item 

//npm init -y ---> This is for package.json file

//FOR CREATING SERVER WE USE OR RUN IN TERMINAL THAT IS npm i express

here first we create for user that is registration login and logout etc-------

-----------------
app.js me server create krenge and server.js me server start krenge

Now we run,npx nodemon server.js Here nodemonis used because if we have any changes in the js file then it automatically restart the server with new changes
For testing the server we used PostMan 
POSTMAN :- It is an application where we developed the API and Check the API which we already created

NOW AFTER CREATING AND STARTING THE SERVER NOW WE HAVE TO CONNECT THE SERVER WITH DATABASE AND For this I USEd MONGOdb
so,
for this i run in terminal that is --> (npm i mongoose) which install the several package for dataBase.

DB.JS me hmlog logic likhte hain kis trh hmara server database se connect hoga

--> API ke saath me jo hmlog calback likhte hain usse hmlog controller bolte hain 

int Authocont.js me the password we give it in hashedPassword becz it safe the critical and more details of user in privacy 
for hashing the password we use the library bcrypts (npm i bcrypt)

AND for saving the password and user details for user we use cookie becz if they again come for login then we know who are they and from where they come
for this we use the library that is (npm i cookie-parser) means we create token for user and save it in cookie 

--->>>>>Frontend pe hm password kbhi nhi bhejte due to security reasons

So finally for register user we create an API is successfully



Video upload krne ke baad hm usse database me save krte hain uske liye hmne multer ka use kiya hai kyunki without it shows undefined
so for this we run in terminal that is (npm i multer)


 apna  file ko server pe nhi krta hai usse hmlog apne Hard disk yaa ssd me save krte hain becz when server is deployed then we dont have access to server file system, SSD or Hard disk so we use cloud storage provider(like google drive) jese ki imagekit, Cloudinary etc.

 In this i use IMAGEKIT for storing the file in cloud

 Imagekit is a cloud storage provider jisme hmlog apna file store krte hain and uske bad hmlog usse access krte hain by url jo hmlogko imagekit provide krta hai.
